Alan Ma's Portfolio
<br>
Hey, I'm a first year Software Engineering student at the University of Waterloo! I've created a few websites for both school and personal projects, which use a combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, and AngularJS.
<br>
I am also learning Python, which I use during coding competitions (I plan on learning C++ later on). I'm also quite intersted in algorithms, machine learning (I wrote a research paper on this!), and cryptography.
<br>
The website is built with plain old HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery. It currently shows my resume; I plan on adding projects and other features later on.
