Alan Ma's Portfolio
<br>
Hey, I'm a high school student who enjoys coding! I've created a few websites for both school and personal projects, which use a combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, and AngularJS.
<br>
I am also learning Python as well as algorithms, which are quite interesting.
<br>
The website currently shows my resume; actual website WIP.
